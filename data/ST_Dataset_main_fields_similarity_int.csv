33,Alcoholic beverages (except beer),2,32,Beer,"‘Alcoholic beverages (except beer)’ is a broad category which includes various kinds of alcoholic beverages in view of their ingredients, methods of manufacturing, alcohol content, occasions in which they are consumed. Among others, such category encompasses alcoholic beverages, such as ‘cider’, which are characterized by a low-alcohol content just like beers. Alcoholic drinks, such as ‘cider’, on the one hand, and beers, on the other, are intended to quench thirst and consumed on the same occasions and in the same places. Moreover, they are offered in the same commercial establishments, placed in the same sections (15/11/2006, T-366/05, Budweiser, EU:T:2006:347, § 45; 05/10/2011, T-421/10, Rosalia de Castro, EU:T:2011:565, § 31).

33,Alcoholic beverages (except beer),2,32,Non-alcoholic beverages,"Similarity is found between the broader categories of non-alcoholic beverages in Class 32 and alcoholic beverages (except beers) in Class 33, as some specific non-alcoholic drinks are similar to some specific alcoholic drinks. For example, alcohol free wine in Class 32 and wine in Class 33. There is a growing trend in the drinks market sector for winemaking companies to also produce and offer non-alcoholic wine as an alternative to alcoholic wine. Non-alcoholic wine often goes through the same fermentation and ageing process as alcoholic wine, only to have the alcohol removed at the last stages (either through distillation or filtration). Non-alcoholic wine is intended to be consumed in the same circumstances as alcoholic wine by consumers who cannot, or choose not to, consume alcohol. Since consumers will perceive them as alternative products they must also be considered to be in competition. It is not uncommon for non-alcoholic wine to be sold in wine shops or specialised wine sections in supermarkets.","['5. Goods / services in competition', '6. Distribution channels', '7.

The same is true with regard to some fishmongers who offer their customers a selection of fish and seafood to take away or to be cooked and eaten on the premises (in an adjoining restaurant). Even though the comparison is between services on the one hand and goods on the other, the different nature and objectives of those goods and services cannot counteract the similarity which exists in terms of basic goods, customers and points of sale.
